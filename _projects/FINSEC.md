FINSEC (Integrated Framework for Predictive and Collaborative Security of Financial Infrastructures) is a flagship project which will develop, demonstrate and bring to market an integrated, intelligent, collaborative and predictive approach to the security of critical infrastructures in the financial sector. To this end, FINSEC will introduce, implement and validate a novel reference architecture for integrated physical and cyber security of critical infrastructures, which will enable handling of dynamic, advanced and asymmetric attacks, while at the same time boosting financial organizationsâ€™ compliance to security standards and regulations. As a result, FINSEC will provide a blueprint for the next generation security systems for the critical infrastructures of the financial sector.
