goals: >
    In the first step, EU-wide development of technological and standardisation background will be exploited and results will be made available in reports. Also, data and infrastructure security threats will be identified. The results of step one will serve as an input for the configuration, and adaption of testbeds, simulations and software platforms of partners, participating in the SESec-EU network.

role: >
    Our contribution was the formal modeling  and mechanical analysis of security protocols and policies used in SES. In particular, we considered the Privacy-Preserving Billing Protocol for smart metering. This analysis has been conducted leveraging the automatic techniques for the security analysis developed in the context of the carrier project SIAM.

partners: >
    The consortium involves partners from four European nodes and combines expertise for SES in the aspects of infrastructure and device security, data security and privacy on all levels of the future smart grid from transmission down to device management and building control.
