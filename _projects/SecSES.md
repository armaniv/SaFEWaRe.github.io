role: >
    Our contribution is the formal modeling and the mechanical analysis of security protocols and policies used in the complex scenario of the Secure Smart Home Energy Gateway for Smart Buildings.

goals: >
    One of the objectives of the activity is to implement security and privacy related features for an energy box in a smart home gateway.

partners: >
    The activity brings together the competence and expertise of eight partners.  With respect to the secure smart home gateway, the activity builds on the networking expertise of Telecom Italia. It is then combined with the expertise in formal protocol security analysis of FBK, joined with the background in security certification of Engineering, and the expertise in data privacy and anomaly detection of two academic partners. With respect to targeted attacks, the activity builds on the track record of  two academic partners in targeted attack detection and power system IT infrastructures. The technical expertise is completed by the standardization experience of Siemens.
