FIDES is an activity in the context of the EIT ICT Labs activities 2016 (Innovation Area: Privacy, Security and Trust) built on results achieved in 2015.

Building on results achieved in its first year, in 2016 FIDES will be extended to become a EU-wide platform for federated identity management, and concrete business cases will be demonstrated in partnering countries (IT, NL and ES). FIDES will be consolidated to integrate mobile-related innovative technologies for secure identity management and privacy-preserving attribute-based authentication system. Business owners will establish a consortium to commercialize FIDES towards third parties.
