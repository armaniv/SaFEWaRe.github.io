FIDES is an activity in the context of the EIT ICT Labs activities 2015 (Innovation Area: Privacy, Security and Trust).

Building on results of relevant European initiatives, such as STORK, FutureID, Kantara and SDIM, the FIDES project will define a technical blueprint for a federated and interoperable identity management platform, compliant with the current regulations, such as eIDAS, Data Protection and the most relevant national legislations, such as SPID in Italy, in order to define suitable guidelines for a privacy-preserving identity infrastructure service provider.
