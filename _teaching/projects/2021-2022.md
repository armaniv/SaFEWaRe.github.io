  - title: Attack patterns for Identity Management protocols
    description: >
      Identity Management (IdM) protocols are the protocols supporting Single-Sign On (SSO) which is an authentication schema allowing the user to access different services using the same set of credentials. Two of the most known IdM protocols are SAML 2.0 SSO and OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect. Several solutions for corporations like Google, Meta (Facebook) and for Public Administration like eIDAS and SPID are based on IdM protocols. We propose to define attack patterns for assessing the security of IdM implementations. This activity can include the implementation of a plugin.

  - title: Attribute-based Encryption for Advanced Data Protection in IoT with MQTT
    description: >
      While yielding many benefits, emerging paradigms such as the Edge and the Internet-of-Things (IoT) threaten the confidentiality of users' sensitive data. In such a complex and dynamic scenario, fine-grained Access Control (AC) policies are necessary to control data sharing. However, traditional approaches to AC leave data unencrypted and at the mercy of curious service providers. The main goal of this project is to investigate how Attribute-based Encryption (ABE) can guarantee advanced data protection from all unauthorized entities while enforcing fine-grained Attribute-based AC (ABAC) policies in IoT scenarios using the MQTT protocol.

  - title: Denial of Service attacks in MQTT 5.0 features
    description:
      - MQTT is a lightweight message protocol standardized by OASIS and considered the de-facto standard for the Internet of Things (IoT). It follows the publish-subscribe paradigm, where a central entity (the broker) forwards messages received by publishing clients to subscribed clients via topics (a sort of message queues). As clients typically have constrained resources, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are among the main security issues in IoT.
      - "The goal of this project is to review the features introduced by OASIS in the last version of the MQTT protocol in light of their misuse to provoke DoS attacks to the clients or the broker: identify the features from the protocol v.5.0 specification and verify their adoption among the most widely used MQTT clients and brokers; then, implement the identified attacks in MQTTSA: a command-line tool that automatically detects misconfigurations in MQTT brokers and provides a report of the potential vulnerabilities and a list of recommendations and code snippets."
    supervisor:
      - UmbertoMorelli
    objectives:
      - Investigate the OASIS MQTT v.5.0 specification [1] for features that would enable client- and broker-side DoS attacks.
      - Review available literature.
      - Verify the correct adoption of the identified MQTT v.5.0 features among its most common broker and client implementations (at least two brokers and two clients).
      - Integrate the proposed approach in the DoS plugin of MQTTSA [2].
    prerequisites:
      - Experience in Python programming.
      - English.
    topics:
      - MQTT
      - Denial of Service (DoS)

  - title: Security and Risk Analysis of Enrollment Procedures
    description:
      - "Enrollment is a procedure to identify people remotely; this way, many companies allow customers to perform sensitive operations without leaving home. However, companies must sturdily design enrollment procedures and adopt suitable security mechanisms to prevent impersonation. Otherwise, consequences would be catastrophic: malicious agents could exploit bank accounts for money laundering or other unlawful aims, access other people’s sensitive data, and even sign contracts under another name."
      - The goal of this project is to analyse how the security and risk of enrollment procedures can be enhanced, also in light of a recent report on remote identity proofing issued by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA). Some cutting-edge technologies will be explored, such as electronic documents (i.e., eID cards and ePassports) that are considerably simplifying sensitive online operations thanks to their cryptographic features.
    supervisor:
      - MarcoPernpruner
      - GiadaSciarretta
    objectives:
      - Familiarization with the report on remote identity proofing issued by ENISA.
      - Investigation into the security and risk of enrollment procedures based on different security means (such as eDocuments).
      - Extension of an existing tool for the analysis of enrollment procedures, developed within the Security & Trust unit.
    prerequisites:
      - Basic knowledge of cybersecurity.
      - Experience in Python programming is appreciated.
    topics:
      - Enrollment
      - Risk Analysis
      - Security Analysis

  - title: Smishing
    description:
      - Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message.
      - Smishing is a phishing attack carried out over mobile text messaging, also known as SMS phishing.
      - As a variant of phishing, victims are deceived into giving sensitive information to a disguised attacker. SMS phishing can be assisted by malware or fraud websites. It occurs on many mobile text messaging platforms, including non-SMS channels like WhatsApp.
      - The student will develop a framework that continuously monitors websites that are used to report potential phishing messages and automatically identify trending phishing campaigns, involved entities (e.g., Poste Italiane), and indicators of compromises (IOCs).
