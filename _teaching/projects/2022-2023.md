    title: Attack patterns for Identity Management protocols
    description: >
      Identity Management (IdM) protocols are the protocols supporting Single-Sign On (SSO) which is an authentication schema allowing the user to access different services using the same set of credentials. Two of the most known IdM protocols are SAML 2.0 SSO and OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect. Several solutions for corporations like Google, Meta (Facebook) and for Public Administration like eIDAS and SPID are based on IdM protocols. We propose to define attack patterns for assessing the security of IdM implementations. This activity can include the implementation of a plugin.

    title: "Dematerialization of documents: A Digital Travel Credential Case Study"
    description: >
      Over recent years, technology has radically evolved in fields such as identity, security, biometrics and mobile applications. Technology has already transformed the world of border security and efficient processing of passengers, for example, through secure ePassports (also known as electronic Machine Readable Travel Documents or eMRTD), automated eGates, biometrics used to assure visa regimes, and mobile boarding pass. However, the story is far from complete. A newer generation of secure and efficient solutions is just beginning with the development of Digital Travel Credentials (DTC). The project aims to explore state of the art and compare existing approaches toward DTC.

Its prototype, internally available, has been designed to manage different sets of questions (divided by topic and complexity).

    title: Enhancing TLSAssistant analysis capabilities
    description: >
      TLSAssistant v2 is the latest version of our state-of-the-art analysis tool [1], a modular framework able to perform a wide set of checks and easily extensible with new features. Its main focus is to streamline the mitigation process of known and newly discovered TLS attacks, even for non-expert users.
      The main goal of this internship is to extend its capabilities by implementing a new analysis module, able to increase the amount of available checks (e.g., certificate chain validation, compliance analysis, and many more). Due to the research-focused nature of the internship, it will require a large amount of determination and willingness to overcome various challenges.

    title: Key Recovery Protocols for Cryptographic Cloud-hosted Data Protection
    description: >
      Cryptographic Access Control (CAC) is often employed to protect the confidentiality of Cloud-hosted sensitive data from curious service providers while enforcing access control policies. In CAC, data are encrypted, and the secret decrypting keys embody the permission to access the encrypted data. Unfortunately, an eventual loss of these keys would result in the total loss of the encrypted data. The main goal of this project is to investigate the feasibility and use of key recovery mechanisms in CAC to mitigate eventual key losses [1]. Activities include literature research, high-level design and possibly implementation of the proposed approach in a tool [2] developed and actively maintained by the Security&Trust unit in FBK [3].

    title: Multi-Authority Attribute-based Encryption for Secure Access Control in Blockchain-based Applications
    description: >
      Given the limited trust and inherently centralized nature of Cloud-based applications, the Blockchain may be the solution to guarantee integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data in cross-organizational scenarios. However, the basic security properties offered by the Blockchain should be complemented with fine-grained access control (e.g., attribute-based access control - ABAC) enforced through cryptography (e.g., attribute-based encryption - ABE) for best security. The main goal of this project is to investigate how multi-authority ABE is and can be used in Blockchain-based applications to enforce cross-organizational ABAC policies.

    title: Privacy enhancing technologies for digital identity
    description: >
      There is a strong interest in privacy-enhancing technologies to satisfy the complex requirements of digital identity, in particular minimizing the personal data shared at each presentation, and preventing others from correlating the activity of digital identity holders between presentations. Important use cases are the Mobile Drivers’ License (ISO 18013-5) and the European Digital Identity Wallet, with a toolbox for the latter currently under development and expected to be first released in october 2022.
      Many technologies based on cryptography have been proposed to provide solutions for  credential status requests, selective disclosure of attributes, and unlinkability of credential presentations, such as cryptographic accumulators, zero-knowledge proofs, commitments, and blind signatures. During the internship, you will have an opportunity to consider theoretical and practical aspects of these technologies, to be agreed based on your interest and prior knowledge. Examples include:
      <ul>
        <li>Estimate <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/663">BBS+</a> performance vs hash lists, Merkle and verkle trees for selective disclosure.</li>
        <li>Use <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa-python">Ursa python wrapper</a> or <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/node-bbs-signatures">node-bbs-signatures</a> to benchmark bbs performance vs alternatives.</li>
        <li>Use <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">jsonld-signatures-bbs</a> to generate a verifiable credential analogous to an MDL; compare and contrast.</li>
        <li>Compare <a href="https://github.com/AnonCreds-WG/anoncreds-spec">anoncreds</a> (<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-28628-8_4">Camenisch-Lysyanskaya</a>) and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/u-prove/">u-prove</a> (<a href="http://www.credentica.com/the_mit_pressbook.html">Brands</a>).</li>
        <li>Compare Merkle tree proposals for <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/Merkle-Disclosure-2021/jwp/">selective disclosure</a> and <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9162">certificate transparency</a>. Study more efficient proofs of inclusion for multiple leaves, e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.07648.pdf">compact multiproof</a>. Try to reproduce these using libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/antouhou/rs-merkle">rs-merkle</a>, <a href="https://github.com/miguelmota/merkletreejs">merkletreejs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Tierion/pymerkletools">pymerkletools</a>.</li>

    title: Threat Modeling for Electronic Voting
    description: >
      There has been renewed interest in electronic and internet voting systems in recent years, due in part to the pandemic, and to logistic difficulties in collecting votes from abroad.
      Electoral systems have complex and unusual requirements, and electronic voting systems doubly so - see e.g. <a href="https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=0900001680726f6f">Council of Europe Recommendations</a> and US <a href="https://www.eac.gov/voting-equipment/voluntary-voting-system-guidelines">voluntary voting systems</a> guidelines. While end-to-end verifiable systems show promise of increased trustworthiness for the public, electronic and internet voting systems have come under scrutiny for significant vulnerabilities [1, 2].<br />
      Threat modeling works to identify, communicate, and understand threats and mitigations within the context of protecting something of value. In this internship, the candidate will apply threat modeling tools and processes to the example of electronic voting.
