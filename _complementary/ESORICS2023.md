In the paper, we present and formalize an approach to evaluate enrollment processes and provide comprehensive information on their security, risk and compliance. The evaluation is based on a set of actions, threats, security controls and requirements. To facilitate the adoption of the approach, we provide a preliminary configuration dataset, which currently identifies actions, threats, security controls and their relationship. To obtain the dataset, we have extended the information in the [*Remote ID Proofing* report](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-report-remote-id-proofing) by ENISA, by adding actions, some new threats and security controls, as well as by properly associating them.

The preliminary configuration dataset can be found at [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19sL-VsMDj96Iayo1UUquCIkR3L3tnW5s/edit). Blue text in the first column of a row means that we have identified the content of the row ourselves (i.e., it was not present in the ENISA report).
