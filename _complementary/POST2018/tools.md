**SATMC** (SAT-based Model Checker) is an open and flexible platform for model-checking security protocols via reduction to SAT.  SATMC takes as input a security protocol and can determine whether the concurrent execution of a  finite number of sessions of the specified protocol satisfies the expected security properties inspite of the interference of a malicious intruder. The verification of the security properties is performed interfacing with state-of-the-art SAT solvers ([MiniSat](http://minisat.se) and [zChaff](http://www.ee.princeton.edu/~chaff/zchaff.html) are currently supported) and is based on the use of LTL logic.

For our analyses, we used SATMC (Version 3.5.7) launched within Eclipse using the **STIATE Plugin** (Version 1.0.0.1).
