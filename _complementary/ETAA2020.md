### SAML Tests
In Section 3.1 of the paper we mentioned a list of SAML tests. The table below reports all the tests that the Pentesting tool perform in SAML implementations.

|Security Test|Prot.|Provider |P/A|Description|Mitigation|
| ------------ | -- | ------- | - | --------- | -------- |
| Missing Service Provider | S | IdP | P | Check whether the Issuer element is present in the SAML request. | Configure the IdP to accept only SAML request with Issuer attribute. |
| Missing Audience element | S | IdP | P | Check whether the Audience element is present in the SAML assertion. | Configure the IdP to include Audience element in the SAML assertion. |
| Missing OneTimeUse attribute | S | IdP | P | Check whether OneTimeUse attribute is present in the SAML assertion. | Configure the IdP to include OneTimeUse attribute in the SAML assertion. |
| Missing NotOnOrAfter attribute | S | IdP | P | Check whether NotOnOrAfter attribute is present in the SAML assertion. | Configure the IdP to include NotOnOrAfter attribute in the SAML assertion. |
| Missing InResponseTo attribute | S | IdP | P | Check whether InResponseTo attribute is present in the SAML assertion. | Configure the IdP to include InResponseTo attribute in the SAML assertion. |
| Missing Recipient in SubjectConfirmationData | S | IdP | P | Check whether Recipient attribute is present in the SAML assertion. | Configure the IdP to include Recipient attribute in SubjectConfirmationData element of SAML assertion. |
| Missing check on Recipient element | S | SP | P | Check whether the Recipient attribute is present in the SAML assertion. | Configure the Client to accept only SAML assertions with Recipient attribute. |
| Missing check on the InResponseTo attribute | S | SP | P | Check whether the InResponseTo attribute is present in the SAML assertion. | Configure the Client to accept only SAML assertions with InResponseTo attribute. |
| Missing check on NotOnOrAfter attribute | S | SP | P | Check whether the NotOnOrAfter attribute is present in the SAML assertion. | Configure the Client to accept only SAML assertions with NotOnOrAfter attribute. |
| Missing check on Destination element | S | SP | P | Check whether the Destination element is present in the SAML assertion. | Configure the Client to accept only SAML assertions with Destination element. |
| Missing OneTimeUse attribute | S | SP | P | Check whether the OneTimeUse attribute is present in the SAML assertion. | Configure the Client to accept only SAML assertions with OneTimeUse attribute. |
| Missing check on Audience element | S | SP | P | Check whether the Audience element is present in the SAML assertion. | Configure the Client to accept only SAML assertions with Audience element. |
| Alteration of the Relay State parameter | S | SP | A | Changes value of Relay State parameter. | Configure the Sanitize the value of Relay State parameter. |
| Session Fixation | S | SP | A | Check whether the implementation suffers the session vulnerability. | Handle properly the user sessions. |
| Missing check on Canonicalization algorithm | S | Any | P | Check if the Canonicalization algorithm used by the XML parser encode also comments. | Change XML parser Canonicalization algorithm to one that includes comments. |

### Tools
Micro-Id-Gym a tool which offering on the one hand (in the laboratory) an easy way to configure the production environment in a sandbox where pentesters can develop hands-on experiences on how IdM solutions work, performing attacks with high impacts and better understand the underlying security issues. On the other hand (in the wild) a set of pentesting tools for the automatic security analysis of IdM protocols are provided.
