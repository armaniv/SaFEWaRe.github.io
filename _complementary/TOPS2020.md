### ASLan++ Specs
In our paper, we present two reference models that we have derived from two real use-case scenarios (see Section 4):
- *RM_TOTP*, which involves mobile native applications and the use of a Time-based OTP approach, and
- *RM_CR*, which involves an electronic identity card and a Challenge-Response approach.

To analyze these reference models, we have modeled them using ASLan++, a high-level language that formalizes the interactions between the different protocol roles.

For both the reference models we have performed three different analyses: on the security assumptions and on the multi-factor and OTP goals (see Section 6).

### Tools
**SATMC** (SAT-based Model Checker) is an open and flexible platform for model-checking security protocols via reduction to SAT.  SATMC takes as input a security protocol and can determine whether the concurrent execution of a  finite number of sessions of the specified protocol satisfies the expected security properties inspite of the interference of a malicious intruder. The verification of the security properties is performed  interfacing with state-of-the-art SAT solvers ([MiniSat](http://minisat.se) and [zChaff](https://www.princeton.edu/~chaff/zchaff.html) are currently supported) and is based on the use of LTL logic.

For our analyses, we used SATMC (Version 3.5.7) launched within Eclipse using the **STIATE Plugin** (Version 1.0.0.1).
