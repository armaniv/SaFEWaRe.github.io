This research investigates the development of automatic and semi-automatic methods and tools to support organizations in 
achieving compliance of their AI-based software systems with regulations such as the AI Act, GDPR, NIS2, CRA, and DORA.

Our goal is to produce a set of interoperable tools and patterns that operationalize compliance-by-design principles, 
promote transparency, and reduce the compliance burden on organizations deploying AI-enabled solutions.
