OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect are two of the most widely used protocols to support secure and frictionless access delegation and single sign-on login solutions within web and mobile native applications.


**Our focus**:
- Design of innovative scenarios: government profile, issuing and presentation of credentials using a wallet application
- Assist mobile native application developers with the secure implementation of OAuth and OIDC solutions
- Security analysis and pentesting of OAuth and OIDC solutions
