Digital Identity Management is a key enabler for the adoption of innovative digital and physical services. It creates identity ecosystem across organization/company boundaries and injects trust (added value for citizens and public and private sectors).
 
**Our focus**:
- Formal specification and analysis of authentication/authorization protocols and access control policies
- Secure-by-design principles and best practices for authentication/authorization protocols
- Automated synthesis of enforcement mechanisms from high-level access control policies
