This research aims to support engineers across the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) through AI-based 
platforms and environments powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling secure and trustworthy analysis, design, 
and development of AI-based software systems. 

It also addresses challenges such as hallucinations, biases, data privacy risks, and code vulnerabilities via tools 
like prompt vulnerability detectors, SBOM analysers, and static/dynamic code analysers.
