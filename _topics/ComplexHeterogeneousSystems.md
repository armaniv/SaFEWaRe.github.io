The unit develops cutting-edge security solutions for Complex and
Heterogeneous systems. These include authentication and authorization
mechanisms for  Mobile, Application Programming Interface, Cloud/Edge
computing, Internet of Things, and Distributed Ledger Technology.

**Our focus**: Design and tool development for
- Access control policies in the cloud
- Controlled information sharing (NATO: declarative Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) policy specification, model, and enforcement)
- Securing MQTT-based environments
