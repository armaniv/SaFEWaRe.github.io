Multi-Factor Authentication protocols are nowadays widely used to protect sensitive data. However, they highly differ in terms of features, provided security level and user experience.

**MuFASA** is a tool for high-level specification and analysis of MFA protocols, which aims at supporting normal users and security experts (in the design phase of an MFA protocol), providing a high level report regarding possible risks associated to the specified MFA protocol, its resistance to a set of attacker models (defined by [NIST](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.nist.gov%2F800-63-3%2Fsp800-63b.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEj0k6CXeZx8Gno3pNmIyYjtBCIpg)), its ease-of-use and its compliance with a set of security requirements derived from European laws.

The tool is available on request. If you are interested in trying the tool, please contact us via email.
