### Description

To facilitate the adoption of cloud by organizations, *cryptographic access control* is the obvious solution to control data sharing among users while preventing partially trusted cloud service providers to access sensitive data. In this context, **CryptoAC** implements a state of the art role-based cryptographic access control scheme proposed by [**Garrison et al**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.09069). **CryptoAC** comes with an easy deployment process, it supports 81 different architectures and it is cloud-independent, i.e., it can be seamlessly deployed in all major cloud service providers.
