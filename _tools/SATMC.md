SAT-based Model-Checker for Security Protocols and Security-sensitive Applications.

**Features**: SATMC provides a number of distinguishing features, including the ability to:
- check the protocol against complex temporal properties (e.g. fair exchange);
- analyze protocols (e.g. browser-based protocols) that assume messages are carried over secure channels (e.g. SSL/TLS channels).

We are currently the main developers of the tool.
