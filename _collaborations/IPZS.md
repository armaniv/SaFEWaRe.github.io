Created in June 2017, the Digimat joint lab between [Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato Italiano](http://www.ipzs.it/ext/index.html) (IPZS) and FBK-ICT performs research and innovation activities in digital identity solutions. One of the main goals is to investigate how the new (NFC-enabled) identity card ([Carta Identit√† Elettronica 3.0](http://www.ipzs.it/ext/carta_identita_elettronica_prodotti.html)) may be integrated in authentication and authorization solutions for digital or integrated digital-physical services. The idea is, on the one hand, to augment the level of assurance and, on the other hand, to improve the user experience of the security solutions using the identity card.
