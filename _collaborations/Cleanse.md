The Co-Innovation Lab was born in 2016 from the collaboration with [Deda](https://www.deda.com/home). 

In 2024 the two companies founded [Cleanse](https://www.deda.com/gruppo/corporate-governance/technology-innovation/co-innovation-lab), 
a laboratory that aims to anticipate the new security requirements that will emerge from cloud-native software.
