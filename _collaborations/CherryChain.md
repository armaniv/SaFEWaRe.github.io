Started in 2019, the collaboration between [CherryChain](https://www.cherrychain.it/) and FBK-ICT performs research and innovation activities in the field of *Distributed Ledger Technology* and *Smart Contract*. One of the main goals is to investigate how existing digital identity solutions can be enforced in a distributed system.  In this context, we are currently involved in the design of on-boarding and signature procedures. At the same time, we are investigating innovative digital identity solutions based on decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials.
