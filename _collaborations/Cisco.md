Active since 2006, the SaFEWaRe unit collaborates with [Cisco Systems Inc.](https://www.cisco.com), a worldwide leader 
in networking and telecommunications. The primary research activities are focused on the definition and development of 
new control plane protocols for dynamically switching optical networks. Our unit develops and maintains a Java library 
for the Path Computation Element, the functional entity responsible for the routing and the resource allocation on 
optical networks. This PCE specializes in the selection of optimal paths through a network, resource allocation, as well
as in the validation of the feasibility of optical lightpath routes.

Cisco is a member of the Executive Tecnical Board of the [Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF)](https://www.oiforum.com/) and is a leader in 
defining the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm.
