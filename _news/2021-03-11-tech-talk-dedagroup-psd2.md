On March 11, 2021, the Security & Trust Unit held the Tech Talk "Scenari, approcci, esperienze di strong authentication pre e post direttiva PSD2" for [Dedagroup](https://www.deda.group/home).

After an introduction by Silvio Ranise on the Security & Trust research unit, Marco Pernpruner talked about the PSD2 and its effects on authentication protocols, finally describing a methodology that we have developed to analyse the security and risk of such protocols. Then, Andrea Bisegna and Roberto Carbone provided details and a practical demonstration about the  Micro-Id-Gym tool, developed within the research unit.
