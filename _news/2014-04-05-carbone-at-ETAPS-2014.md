The European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS) is the primary European forum for academic and industrial researchers working on topics relating to Software Science. ETAPS, established in 1998, is a confederation of six main annual conferences (CC, ESOP, FASE, FoSSaCS, POST and TACAS) accompanied by satellite workshops and other events.

On Monday, 7th April, Roberto Carbone will present the following paper: Alessandro Armando, Roberto Carbone and Luca Compagna. *SATMC: a SAT-based Model Checker for Security-critical Systems*.

This paper has been accepted as Regular tool paper at the 20th International Conference on Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems (TACAS). TACAS is a forum for researchers, developers and users interested in rigorously based tools and algorithms for the construction and analysis of systems. The conference serves to bridge the gaps between different communities with this common interest and to support them in their quest to improve the utility, reliability, flexibility and efficiency of tools and algorithms for building systems.
