The **14th IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium** (NOMS 2014) will be held **5-9 May 2014** at Radisson Park Inn, Krakow, **Poland**. Held in even-numbered years since 1988, NOMS 2014 will follow the 26 years tradition of NOMS and IM as the primary IEEE Communications Society's forum for technical exchange on management of information and communication technology focusing on research, development, integration, standards, service provisioning, and user communities. NOMS 2014 will focus on the theme "Management in a Software-Defined World," presenting recent, emerging approaches, and technical solutions for dealing with future network and ICT infrastructures, as well as with novel services provided on top of these infrastructures in virtual environments (e.g., Cloud Computing and SDN).
