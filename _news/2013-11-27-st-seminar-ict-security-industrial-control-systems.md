abstract: >
    Most industrial processes are controlled and operated by systems that heavily use ICT components and that are not isolated as they used to be. Hence, cyber threats can be a major concern for critical infrastructures like energy power generation, water / gas transportation, and so on. An overview of some specific aspects of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) is presented, together with some insights about their cyber security issues and possibile solutions.
