Amir Sharif has been chosen as a recipient of the [2023 OpenID Foundation Kim Cameron Award](https://openid.net/2023/02/27/2023-kim-cameron-awards/). The award aims to encourage representation from young people who have an interest in subjects consistent with the [OpenID Foundation](https://openid.net/) Mission, in creating identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy preserving.

The OpenID Foundation Kim Cameron Award is a recognition of the importance of mentoring a new generation of domain experts and thought leaders in user centric identity. The Foundation is interested in increasing representation from those who’ve demonstrated an academic and practical interest in subjects consistent with OpenID Foundation’s Mission.

Award recipients will be studying, researching, interning or working in a field relevant to one or more [OpenID Foundation working groups](https://openid.net/wg/) and consistent with Foundation’s Mission. The recipients will also be invited to participate in Foundation breakout meetings at the European Identity Conference and Identiverse which will provide exposure to both the Foundation’s business as well as leading technologists.

Congratulations!
