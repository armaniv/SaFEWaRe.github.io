    - title: "Audit-Based Access Control with a Distributed Ledger: Applications to Healthcare Organizations"
      authors: Umberto Morelli, Silvio Ranise, Damiano Sartori, Giada Sciarretta and Alessandro Tomasi
      abstract: >
        We propose an audit-based architecture that leverages the Hyperledger Fabric distributed ledger as a means to increase accountability and decentralize the authorization decision process of Attribute-Based Access Control policies by using smart contracts. Our goal is to decrease the trust in administrators and users with privileged accounts, and make the a posteriori verification of access events more reliable. We implement our approach to the use case of Electronic Health Record access control. Preliminary experiments show the viability of the proposed approach.
