    - title: "Validating Requirements of Access Control for Cloud-Edge IoT Solutions"
      authors: Tahir Ahmad and Silvio Ranise
      abstract: >
        The pervasiveness of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions have stimulated research on the basic security mechanisms needed in the wide range of IoT use case scenarios, ranging from home automation to industrial control systems. We focus on access control for cloud-edge based IoT solutions for which—in previous work—we have proposed a lazy approach to Access Control as a Service for the specification, administration, and enforcement of policies. The validity of the approach was evaluated in a realistic smart-lock scenario. In this paper, we argue that the approach is adaptable to a wide range of IoT use case scenarios by validating the requirements elicited when analyzing the smart lock scenario.
