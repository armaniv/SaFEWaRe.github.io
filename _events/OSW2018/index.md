# Summary
The OAuth Security Workshop (OSW) aim is to improve the security of OAuth and related Internet protocols by a direct exchange of views between academic researchers, IETF OAuth Working Group members and industry. The workshop is hosted by the Security and Trust research unit of the Bruno Kessler Foundation (FBK).

While the standardization process of OAuth ensures extensive reviews (both security and non-security related), further analysis by security experts from academia and industry is essential to ensure high quality specifications. Contributions to this workshop can help to improve the security of the Web and the Internet.
