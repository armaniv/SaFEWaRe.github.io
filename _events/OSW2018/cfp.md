We solicit position papers that highlight challenges and lesson-learned from OAuth-based work. As all papers and presentations will be shared online without a formal proceedings, we accept different kinds of submissions: from original contributions to already published or preliminary works.

Submissions must be in PDF format and should feature reasonable margins and formatting. There is no page limit, but the submission should be brief (ideally not more than 3-5 pages). Submissions should not be anonymized.

Authors of accepted papers will have the option to revise their papers before they are put online. One of the authors of the accepted position paper is expected to present the paper at the workshop.

The workshop will host a half-day (March 14, 2018) tutorial program. Each tutorial proposal should concisely describe the content and objectives of the tutorial, and include:
- title
- abstract
- outline of the tutorial content
- intended audience, including possible assumed background of attendees
- name, affiliation, email address, and brief biography of the speaker(s)
- duration: 1 hour or 2 hours

Tutorial proposals should be submitted as a PDF file.

Submissions should be distinguished by the prefix "Tutorial:" in the title.
