# Keynote
**Speaker**: Daniel dos Santos, Sr. Research Manager - Forescout Technologies

**Bio**: Daniel dos Santos holds a PhD in computer science from the University of Trento, Italy, has published over 30 journal and conference papers on cybersecurity and has spoken at hacking conferences such as Black Hat, Hack In The Box, and x33fcon. He has experience in software development, security testing, and research. He is now a Sr. Research Manager at Forescout Technologies, leading a vulnerability and threat research team, as well as collaborating on the research and development of innovative features for network security monitoring.

**Title**: Analyzing the Impact of Software Supply Chain Vulnerabilities on Critical Infrastructure

**Abstract**:<br />
Over the past 18 months, the Forescout Research Labs team has analyzed, discovered and disclosed close to 100 vulnerabilities on 14 different implementations of embedded TCP/IP stacks. These stacks are foundational software components used in everything from networking equipment and medical devices to industrial control systems. The currently opaque nature of software supply chains makes it challenging to understand the real impact of these vulnerabilities, which in turn complicates vulnerability management for network defenders.
In this talk, we will overview the techniques used in our security analysis, the implementation anti-patterns we observed, the results we obtained and, most importantly, the impact that this research has on critical infrastructure networks and what that means for their protection. We will dedicate part of the talk to one specific critical infrastructure sector: healthcare. We will discuss how our data shows that healthcare organizations are among the most affected by this type of vulnerability and how they often have a combination of diverse vulnerable devices and network misconfigurations that put them in danger.
