He is currently involved in the Security & Trust Research Unit at FBK, in the context of a joint laboratory between FBK and the Italian Government Printing Office and Mint (Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato Italiano, responsible for producing Italian eID cards), whose primary goal is to conduct research and innovation activities in digital identity solutions.


He is working on different projects related to identity and access management that involves the design, and security analysis (with informal specifications) of access delegation and single sign-on protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect).
