Giada Sciarretta is a researcher of the Security & Trust research unit of Fondazione Bruno Kessler. She obtained her MSc in mathematics at the University of Trento in 2012 and received her Ph.D. in computer science at the same University in 2018 while working with the Security & Trust unit. Her research activities involve the design, security analysis (with informal and formal specifications), and risk assessment of access delegation and single sign-on protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect), multi-factor authentication (e.g., based on biometric or eID cards) and fully-remote enrollment procedures. She is currently working on several projects related to identity and access management, focusing on various aspects in the context of the European Digital Identity Wallet (e.g, PID issuing, mDL presentation, selective disclosure).
