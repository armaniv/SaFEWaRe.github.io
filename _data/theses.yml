  title: "Efficient Automated Security Analysis of Complex Authorization Policies"
  type: P
  author: TuanAnhTruong
  abstract: >
    Access Control is becoming increasingly important for today's ubiquitous systems. Sophisticated security requirements need to be ensured by authorization policies for increasingly complex and large applications. As a consequence, designers need to understand such policies and ensure that they meet the desired security constraints while administrators must also maintain them so as to comply with the evolving needs of systems and applications. These tasks are greatly complicated by the expressiveness and the dimensions of the authorization policies. It is thus necessary to provide policy designers and administrators with automated analysis techniques that are capable to foresee if, and under what conditions, security properties may be violated. For example, some analysis techniques have already been proposed in the literature for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies. RBAC is a security model for access control that has been widely adopted in real-world applications. Although RBAC simplifies the design and management of policies, modifications of RBAC policies in complex organizations are difficult and error prone activities due to the limited expressiveness of the basic RBAC model. For this reason, RBAC has been extended in several directions to accommodate various needs arising in the real world such as Administrative RBAC (ARBAC) and Temporal RBAC (TRBAC). This Dissertation presents our research efforts to find the best trade-off between scalability and expressiveness for the design and benchmarking of analysis techniques for authorization policies. We review the state-of-the-art of automated analysis for authorization policies, identify limitations of available techniques and then describe our approach that is based on recently developed symbolic model checking techniques based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solving (for expressiveness) and carefully tuned heuristics (for scalability). Particularly, we present the implementation of the techniques on the automated analysis of ARBAC and ATRBAC policies and discuss extensive experiments that show that the proposed approach is superior to other state-of-the-art analysis techniques. Finally, we discuss directions for extensions.

  title: "Black-Box Security Testing of Browser-Based Security Protocols"
  type: P
  author: AvinashSudhodanan
  abstract: >
    Millions of computer users worldwide use the Internet every day for consuming web-based services (e.g., for purchasing products from online stores, for storing sensitive files in cloud-based file storage web sites, etc.). Browser-based security protocols (i.e. security protocols that run over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and are executable by commercial web-browsers) are used to ensure the security of these services. Multiple parties are often involved in these protocols. For instance, a browser-based security protocol for Single Sign-On (SSO in short) typically consists of a user (controlling a web browser), a Service Provider web site and an Identity Provider (who authenticates the user). Similarly, a browser-based security protocol for Cashier-as-a-Service (CaaS) scenario consists of a user, a Service Provider web site (e.g., an online store) and a Payment Service Provider (who authorizes payments). The design and implementation of browser-based security protocols are usually so complex that several vulnerabilities are often present even after intensive inspection. This is witnessed, for example, by vulnerabilities found in various browser-based security protocols such as SAML SSO v2.0, OAuth Core 1.0, etc. even years after their publication, implementation, and deployment. Although techniques such as formal verification and white-box testing can be used to perform security analysis of browser- based security protocols, currently they have limitations: the necessity of having formal models that can cope with the complexity of web browsers (e.g., cookies, client-side scripting, etc.), the poor support offered for certain programming languages by white-box testing tools, to name a few. What remains is black-box security testing. However, currently available black-box security testing techniques for browser-based security protocols are either scenario-specific (i.e. they are specific for SSO or CaaS, not both) or do not support very well the detection of vulnerabilities enabling replay attacks (commonly referred to as logical vulnerabilities) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF in short). The goal of this thesis is to overcome the drawbacks of the black-box security testing techniques mentioned above. At first this thesis presents an attack pattern-based black-box testing technique for detecting vulnerabilities enabling replay attacks and social login CSRF in multi-party web applications (i.e. web applications utilizing browser-based security protocols involving multiple parties). These attack patterns are inspired by the similarities in the attack strategies of previously-discovered attacks against browser-based security protocols. Second, we present manual and semi-automatic black-box security testing strategies for detecting 7 different types of CSRF attacks, targeting the authentication and identity management functionalities of web sites. We also provide proof-of-concept implementations of our ideas. These implementations are based on OWASP ZAP (a prominent, free and open-source penetration testing tool). This thesis being in the context of an industrial doctorate, we had the opportunity to analyse the use-cases provided by our industrial partner, SAP, to further improve our approach. In addition, to access the effectiveness of the techniques we propose, we applied them against the browser-based security protocols of many prominent web sites and discovered nearly 340 serious security vulnerabilities affecting more than 200 web sites, including the web sites of prominent vendors such as Microsoft, eBay, etc.

  title: "Automatic Techniques for the Synthesis and Assisted Deployment of Security Policies in Workflow-based Applications"
  type: P
  author: DanielDosSantos
  abstract: >
    Workflows specify a collection of tasks that must be executed under the responsibility or supervision of human users. Workflow management systems and workflow-driven applications need to enforce security policies in the form of access control, specifying which users can execute which tasks, and authorization constraints, such as Separation/Binding of Duty, further restricting the execution of tasks at run-time. Enforcing these policies is crucial to avoid frauds and malicious use, but it may lead to situations where a workflow instance cannot be completed without the violation of the policy. The Workflow Satisfiability Problem (WSP) asks whether there exists an assignment of users to tasks in a workflow such that every task is executed and the policy is not violated. The run-time version of this problem amounts to answering user requests to execute tasks positively if the policy is respected and the workflow instance is guaranteed to terminate. The WSP is inherently hard, but solutions to this problem have a practical application in reconciling business compliance (stating that workflow instances should follow the specified policies) and business continuity (stating that workflow instances should be deadlock-free). Related problems, such as finding execution scenarios that not only satisfy a workflow but also satisfy other properties (e.g., that a workflow instance is still satisfiable even in the absence of users), can be solved at deployment-time to help users design policies and reuse available workflow models. The main contributions of this thesis are three: 1. We present a technique to synthesize monitors capable of solving the run-time version of the WSP, i.e., capable of answering user requests to execute tasks in such a way that the policy is not violated and the workflow instance is guaranteed to terminate. The technique is extended to modular workflow specifications, using components and gluing assertions. This allows us to compose synthesized monitors, reuse workflow models, and synthesize monitors for large models. 2. We introduce and present techniques to solve a new class of problems called Scenario Finding Problems, i.e., finding execution scenarios that satisfy properties of interest to users. Solutions to these problems can assist customers during the deployment of reusable workflow models with custom authorization policies. 3. We implement the proposed techniques in two tools. Cerberus integrates monitor synthesis, scenario finding, and run-time enforcement into workflow management systems. Aegis recovers workflow models from web applications using process mining, synthesizes monitors, and invokes them at run-time by using a reverse proxy. An extensive experimental evaluation shows the practical applicability of the proposed approaches on realistic and synthetic (for scalability) problem instances.

  title: "Specification-based Predictive Continuous Monitoring for Cyber Physical Systems with Unobservables"
  type: P
  author: AlessioColetta
  abstract: >
    Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), like IoT and industrial control systems, are typically vulnerable to cyber threats due to a lack of cyber security measures and hard change management. Security monitoring is aimed at improving the situational awareness and the resilience to cyber attacks. Solutions tailored to CPS are required for greater effectiveness. This PhD work proposes a monitoring framework that leverages the knowledge of the CPS in order to specify, check, and predict known critical conditions. This approach is particularly suitable to CPS which are designed for a precise purpose, well documented, and predictable to a good extent. The framework uses a formal logical language to specify quantitative critical conditions and an optimisation linear programming and SMT-based engine. The framework computes a quantitative measure of the criticality of the current CPS system: checking how criticality changes in time enables to predict whether the system is approaching to a critical condition or reaching back a licit state. An important novelty of the approach is the capability of dealing with unobservable variables, for a greater feasibility for real cases, and the possibility to use observation times in critical specifications. This work presents the formal framework, a prototype, a testbed, and first experimental results that validate the feasibility of the approach.

  title: "A Methodology for the Design and Security Assessment of Mobile Identity Management: Applications to real-world scenarios"
  type: P
  author: GiadaSciarretta
  abstract: >
    The widespread use of digital identities in our everyday life, along with the release of sensitive data on many online transactions, calls for Identity Management (IdM) solutions that are secure, privacy-aware, and compatible with new technologies, such as mobile and cloud computing. While there exist many secure IdM solutions for web applications, their adaptation in the mobile context is a new and open challenge. The majority of mobile IdM solutions currently used are based on proprietary protocols and their security analysis lacks standardization in the structure, definitions of notions and entities, and specific considerations to identify the attack surface that turns out to be quite different from well understood web scenarios. This makes a comparison among different solutions very complex or, in the worst case, misleading. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel methodology for the design and security assessment of mobile IdM solutions. The design space is characterized by the identification of: (i) national (e.g., SPID for Italy) and European (e.g., eIDAS) laws, regulations and guideline principles that are particularly relevant to digital identity and privacy; (ii) a list of security and usability requirements that are related to IdM solutions (e.g., single sign-on and multi-factor authentication); (iii) a set of implementation mechanisms that are relevant to authentication and authorization on mobile devices and simplify the satisfaction of the requirements in (ii). All the designed solutions use as blueprint a reference model resulting from a rational reconstruction of the mobile IdM solution adopted by Facebook and a study of the OAuth specification for native applications. Regarding the security assessment, our methodology supports analyses ranging from semi-formal to formal. For the former, an IdM designer is required to specify the security relevant parts of the protocol using message sequence charts, the threat model and the security properties; these offer the starting point to argue whether the protocol satisfies the specified properties. For the latter, an IdM designer is required to specify the protocol flow, the attacker properties and the security properties using one of the available formal specification languages for the description of cryptographic and browser-based protocols, and verify the security property violations using an automated tool for protocol analysis. To validate our approach, we applied it to four different real-world scenarios that represent different functional and usability requirements: 1. TreC: a multi-factor authentication solution with a single sign-on experience for mobile e-Health applications. 2. Smart Community: a secure delegated access solution in the context of smart-cities. 3. DigiMat-Lab (Istituto Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato): a mobile multi-factor authentication solution that uses as second factor the Italian electronic identity card. 4. FIDES: an IdM solution that combines federation and cross-border aspects in the context of the European single digital market. The custom designs obtained by applying our methodology in the four scenarios above show the generality and effectiveness of our methodology. When using formal analysis, we have re-used the specification language and tools developed in the context of the AVANTSSAR EU-founded project.

  author: HariSiswantoro
  abstract: >
    Enforcing legal compliance into software systems is a non-trivial task that requires an interdisciplinary approach. This thesis presents a new methodology for legal compliance checking against European legal provisions, namely the EU Data Protection Directive, the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the revised EU Payment Services Directive. We propose two types of compliance checking mechanisms that should be exploited at design-time or run-time. The former is based on security policy analysis of access control policies. The later is built on top of an approach to synthesizing run-time monitors for workflow-driven applications. Our contributions include a comprehensive methodology for legal compliance checking, the formalization of the regulations and the prototype tool of the implemented compliance methodology.

  title: "Privacy-Aware Risk-Based Access Control Systems"
  type: P
  author: NadiaMetoui
  abstract: >
    Modern organizations collect massive amounts of data, both internally (from their employees and processes) and externally (from customers, suppliers, partners). The increasing availability of these large datasets was made possible thanks to the increasing storage and processing capability. Therefore, from a technical perspective, organizations are now in a position to exploit these diverse datasets to create new data-driven businesses or optimizing existing processes (real-time customization, predictive analytics, etc.). However, this kind of data often contains very sensitive information that, if leaked or misused, can lead to privacy violations. Privacy is becoming increasingly relevant for organization and businesses, due to strong regulatory frameworks (e.g., the EU General Data Protection Regulation GDPR, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA) and the increasing awareness of citizens about personal data issues. Privacy breaches and failure to meet privacy requirements can have a tremendous impact on companies (e.g., reputation loss, noncompliance fines, legal actions). Privacy violation threats are not exclusively caused by external actors gaining access due to security gaps. Privacy breaches can also be originated by internal actors, sometimes even by trusted and authorized ones. As a consequence, most organizations prefer to strongly limit (even internally) the sharing and dissemination of data, thereby making most of the information unavailable to decision-makers, and thus preventing the organization from fully exploit the power of these new data sources. In order to unlock this potential, while controlling the privacy risk, it is necessary to develop novel data sharing and access control mechanisms able to support risk-based decision making and weigh the advantages of information against privacy considerations. To achieve this, access control decisions must be based on an (dynamically assessed) estimation of expected cost and benefits compared to the risk, and not (as in traditional access control systems) on a predefined policy that statically defines what accesses are allowed and denied. In Risk-based access control for each access request, the corresponding risk is estimated and if the risk is lower than a given threshold (possibly related to the trustworthiness of the requester), then access is granted or denied. The aim is to be more permissive than in traditional access control systems by allowing for a better exploitation of data. Although existing risk-based access control models provide an important step towards a better management and exploitation of data, they have a number of drawbacks which limit their effectiveness. In particular, most of the existing risk-based systems only support binary access decisions: the outcome is “allowed” or “denied”, whereas in real life we often have exceptions based on additional conditions (e.g., “I cannot provide this information, unless you sign the following non-disclosure agreement.” or “I cannot disclose this data, because they contain personal identifiable information, but I can disclose an anonymized version of the data.”). In other words, the system should be able to propose risk mitigation measures to reduce the risk (e.g., disclose partial or anonymized version of the requested data) instead of denying risky access requests. Alternatively, it should be able to propose appropriate trust enhancement measures (e.g., stronger authentication), and once they are accepted/fulfilled by the requester, more information can be shared. The aim of this thesis is to propose and validate a novel privacy enhancing access control approach offering adaptive and fine-grained access control for sensitive data-sets. This approach enhances access to data, but it also mitigates privacy threats originated by authorized internal actors. More in detail: 1. We demonstrate the relevance and evaluate the impact of authorized actors’ threats. To this aim, we developed a privacy threats identification methodology EPIC (Evaluating Privacy violation rIsk in Cyber security systems) and apply EPIC in a cybersecurity use case where very sensitive information is used. 2. We present the privacy-aware risk-based access control framework that supports access control in dynamic contexts through trust enhancement mechanisms and privacy risk mitigation strategies. This allows us to strike a balance between the privacy risk and the trustworthiness of the data request. If the privacy risk is too large compared to the trust level, then the framework can identify adaptive strategies that can decrease the privacy risk (e.g., by removing/obfuscating part of the data through anonymization) and/or increase the trust level (e.g., by asking for additional obligations to the requester). 3. We show how the privacy-aware risk-based approach can be integrated to existing access control models such as RBAC and ABAC and that it can be realized using a declarative policy language with a number of advantages including usability, flexibility, and scalability. 4. We evaluate our approach using several industrial relevant use cases, elaborated to meet the requirements of the industrial partner (SAP) of this industrial doctorate.

  title: "Security Testing of Permission Re-delegation Vulnerabilities in Android Applications"
  type: P
  author: BiniamFissehaDemissie
  abstract: >
    Smartphones play an important role in our daily lives. Once used only for communication purposes are now also used for several day-to-day activities ranging from social media and entertainment to privacy sensitive operations such as data storage, fitness tracking, mobile banking and sending/receiving business e-mails. This is achieved thanks to the several smartphone applications (apps) that are available. One of the most popular smartphone operating systems is Android. As of now, there are more than 3 million apps for Android. The Android platform facilitates reuse of apps' functionalities by allowing an app to request a task from another app installed on the same device through inter-process communication mechanism. This possibility is probably one of the reasons for the popularity of Android where an app can reuse a feature available in other apps. However, this integration also poses security risks to the privacy of the end-users if it is not implemented properly. Permission re-delegation vulnerability is a kind of privilege escalation that happens when unprivileged apps exploit this integration feature to make privileged apps perform a privileged action on their behalf. Static analysis techniques as well as run-time protections have been proposed to detect permission re-delegation vulnerabilities. However, as acknowledged by their authors, most of these approaches are affected by many false positives and, hence, fall short of precision because, they do not discriminate between intentional task requests and actual permission re-delegation vulnerabilities. In this thesis, we propose automatic techniques to classify potential permission re-delegation vulnerabilities detected by static analysis in real world Android apps as intentional task requests or actual vulnerabilities and to automatically generate test cases that show how the vulnerabilities can be exploited. This could be helpful for developers to easily analyze their apps and fix vulnerabilities before releasing their apps. The proposed approaches have been experimentally validated with thousands of real world apps and have been seen to perform better than state-of-the-art tools and techniques in terms of precision.

  title: "Security Analysis of Multi-Factor Authentication Security Protocols"
  type: P
  author: FedericoSinigaglia
  abstract: >
    Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is being increasingly adopted by on- line services in order to achieve an adequate level of security. MFA is based on security protocols, called MFA protocols, that integrate the use of credentials with additional identity proofs, called authentication factors (based on knowledge, possession or inherence). The authentication factors are provided through specific objects, called authenticators (e.g., hardware token). To date, MFA has been widely adopted in the most diverse security-critical application scenarios (e.g., online banking, eHealth). Various solutions have been proposed, leveraging MFA protocols which employ different kinds of authenticators and providing different user experience. When considering various MFA protocols, few questions may arise. How do MFA protocols differ in terms of (i) level of protection, (ii) compliance w.r.t. current regulations and (iii) complexity for the user? To answer the question concerning the level of protection, traditional verification techniques for security protocols require a formal specification of the protocol under analysis. However, as a matter of fact, several service providers employ ad-hoc MFA protocols and do not disclose their internals. In addition, classical attacker models, such as the Dolev-Yao adversary, hardly apply. Hence, new protocol modeling techniques and new attacker models should be investigated. Concerning regulations, public and private authorities have introduced directives and guidelines for the design of MFA protocols (e.g., recommendations for online payment services from the European Banking Authority, and the guidelines from NIST about the digital identity management through MFA). In principle, these initiatives aim to guide the design of more secure and usable MFA protocols, but there is no evidence that the existing MFA protocols actually comply with the aforementioned regulations. Thus, a novel methodology is needed to provide such an evidence. The ease-of-use is a relevant aspect to be considered in the analysis of an MFA protocol. Indeed, the use of multiple authenticators in the execution of an MFA protocol can negatively affect user experience, which can have an impact on its security as well. However, none of the research works managed to measure the usability of a conspicuous number of MFA protocols design. Hence, a methodology for evaluating the ease-of-use of an MFA protocol should be identified. In this work, we propose a framework to analyze MFA protocols, which does not rely on the implementation details, being able to assess the (i) level of protection, (ii) compliance w.r.t. current regulations and (iii) complexity for the user. To this aim, we define a specification language which is compatible with the typical (amount of) information publicly released by service providers on the employed MFA protocols. For what concerns the security analysis, we propose an evaluation of MFA protocols in terms of resistance against a set of attacker models, tailored for the specific case of MFA protocols. For what concerns the regulatory aspects and best practices, we include the possibility to evaluate a protocol in terms of compliance with a customizable set of requirements and best practices. Furthermore, for what concerns the ease-of-use of an MFA protocol, we propose a new metric, called complexity, for evaluating a protocol in terms of efforts that an user is required to perform during its execution. The aforementioned framework has been then implemented in a working tool, MuFASA, allowing (even non-expert) users to model an MFA protocol and to automatically analyze it. Finally, the presented framework has been applied on some selected use cases. First, it has been employed in the early stages of the design of a novel MFA protocol, integrated into the Citizens’ Clinical Record platform developed in the Trentino region (Italy). Then, it has been used for performing a latitudinary study on online banking services, allowing us to model and analyze more than 150 MFA protocols employed by banks all over the world.

  abstract: >
    The Internet of Things (IoT) is receiving considerable amount of attention from both industry and academia due to the business models that it enables and the radical changes it introduced in the way people interact with technology. The widespread adaption of IoT in our everyday life generates new security and privacy challenges. In this thesis, we focus on "access control in IoT": one of the key security services that ensures the correct functioning of the entire IoT system. We highlight the key differences with access control in traditional systems (such as databases, operating systems, or web services) and describe a set of requirements that any access control system for IoT should fulfill. We demonstrate that the requirements are adaptable to a wide range of IoT use case scenarios by validating the requirements for access control elicited when analyzing the smart lock system as sample use case from smart home scenario. We also utilize the CAP theorem for reasoning about access control systems designed for the IoT. We introduce MQTT Security Assistant (MQTTSA), a tool that automatically detects misconfigurations in MQTT-based IoT deployments. To assist IoT system developers, MQTTSA produces a report outlining detected vulnerabilities, together with (high level) hints and code snippets to implement adequate mitigations. The effectiveness of the tool is assessed by a thorough experimental evaluation. Then, we propose a lazy approach to Access Control as a Service (ACaaS) that allows the specification and management of policies independently of the Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) while leveraging its enforcement mechanisms. We demonstrate the approach by investigating (also experimentally) alternative deployments in the IoT platform offered by Amazon Web Services on a realistic smart lock solution.

  title: "Analysis of Best Current Practices to Assist Native App Developers with Secure OAuth/OIDC Implementations"
  type: P
  author: AmirSharif
  abstract: >
    OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect are two of the most widely used protocols to support secure and frictionless access delegation and single sign-on login solutions, which have been extensively integrated within web and mobile native applications. While securing the OAuth and OpenID Connect implementations within the web applications is widely investigated, this is not true for mobile native applications due to their peculiarities compared to web applications. Given that, we investigate the availability of necessary information to mobile native application developers. Our investigation reveals that mobile native application developers need to access many sparse documents and understand technical security writing, when they are not necessarily security experts that leads to insecure integration of OAuth and OpenID Connect solutions due to various implementation flaws. Thus, to assist mobile native application developers in the understanding of OAuth and OpenID Connect documentations, we demystify the OAuth and OpenID Connect core documentations and two of the most security-critical profiles for governmental and financial domains, namely “International Government Assurance” and “Financial Grade API” to extract the wealth information and summarize them in plain English. To secure the integration of OAuth and OpenID Connect solutions, the OAuth working group and the OpenID foundation have produced many security-related documents to provide general guidelines and best current practices. These documents explain the features that OAuth and OpenID Connect providers must support and how web and mobile native application developers should implement these solutions for the different use case scenarios. In addition, due to the peculiarities of mobile native applications, the OAuth working group has published the “OAuth 2.0 for Na- tive Apps” documentation dedicated to assist mobile native application developers. Recently, the OAuth working group released AppAuth SDK to support mobile native application developers in the secure implementation of access delegation and single sign-on login solutions within mobile native applications. It enables mobile native applications to authorize and authenticate users by communicating with OAuth and OpenID Connect providers, beside embedding the security and usability best current practices described in [DB17]. We thus perform a comprehensive analysis to investigate the compliance with the best current practices of the main OAuth and OpenID Connect providers and top-ranked Google Play Store applications. Our analysis shows that 7 out of 14 providers, and 5 out of 87 top-ranked Google Play Store applications are fully compliant with the best current practices and none of the Google Play Store applications use AppAuth SDK. We conjecture that the root-causes of the non-compliant solutions are different for OAuth and OpenID Connect providers and Google Play Store applications. Concerning providers, they might be aware of these best current practices violations and their non-compliant solutions can be due to legacy reasons. Concerning Google Play Store applications, their non-compliant solutions can be due to the following: (i) the best current practices documents for OAuth and OpenID Connect are sparse, and mobile native application developers may be either unaware of them or misinterpret them as they are not (necessarily) security expert, (ii) lack of the best current practices adoption by OAuth and OpenID Connect providers that leads to the difficulty in integration of AppAuth SDK within mobile native applications. In addition, even in the case of compliant OAuth and OpenID Connect providers, the mobile native application developers still need to properly configure the AppAuth SDK and write the secure code to invoke the SDK properly within their mobile native applications, which is not a daunting task, and (iii) the pressure on mobile native application developers to provide new functionalities for the mobile native applications may result in prioritizing the functionality over the security—as performing a risk as- assessment procedure is a complex task in the context of OAuth and OpenID Connect solutions—they could not have the resources to perform a risk assessment procedure. The above-mentioned problems motivate us to propose methodologies to assist mobile native application developers with the secure implementation of OAuth and OpenID Connect solutions within their mobile native applications. To this aim, we provide a reference model for OAuth and OpenID Connect solutions by utilizing the extracted information from various documents that can be used within a risk as- assessment approach to enable mobile native application developers with an informed decision w.r.t. their implementation choices. In addition, we design a wizard-based approach and implement it within an Android Studio plugin called mIDAssistant that assists mobile native application developers with automatic integration of the core functionalities and ensures the enforcement of the best current practices by leveraging AppAuth SDK. The effectiveness of our approach has been verified in several real-world scenarios (e.g., pull printing), research and innovation projects (e.g., the EIT Digital activity API Assistant), and in the context of industrial collaborations (Poste Italiane, IPZS). Furthermore, we had the opportunity to present our work to the OAuth working group experts (during the OAuth Security Workshop), and they have shown interest in our approach.

  title: "An Assisted Methodology to Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessment"
  type: P

  abstract: >
    The uptake of digital technologies in our everyday activities today is unlike any time in history. Consequently, the amount of personal data produced and shared is staggering. Indeed, they have become the primary asset for many businesses. While users benefit from online engagement, an increasing number of critics have voiced their privacy concerns. To protect peoples’ fundamental rights concerning processing their personal data, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been introduced. GDPR requires to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) when data processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. For example, where the processing may lead to discrimination, damage to the reputation, loss of confidentiality personal data. Therefore, it requires assessing security risks and privacy risks—we learned identifying the latter is not easy even for information security and data protection experts. GDPR is not clear about when and how to conduct a DPIA. Thus, academic works and legal bodies introduced guidelines and tools to help controllers conduct the DPIA. However, these works lack to either provide an assistance, include all steps of the DPIA or be applicable to all domains. These shortages motivated us to propose an assisted methodology to conduct a DPIA. The methodology provides assistance from identifying the required data type for a given data processing to identifying and evaluating privacy and security risks. We have adopted our methodology to conduct a DPIA-compliance risk analysis for OAuth/OIDC-based financial services. That is because of: (1) the growth of open banking, (2) the necessity of deploying appropriate identity management solutions—as stated in PSD2, which requires to respect the GDPR requirement—and (3) the wide usage of OAuth/OIDC identity management solutions that are secure but error-prone. The methodology can also be used for any OAuth/OIDC-based services.
