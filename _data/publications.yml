  title: Automated symbolic analysis of ARBAC-policies
  authors: Alessandro Armando, Silvio Ranise
  abstract: >
    One of the most widespread framework for the management of access-control policies is Administrative Role Based Access Control (ARBAC). Several automated analysis techniques have been proposed to help maintaining desirable security properties of ARBAC policies. One limitation of many available techniques is that the sets of users and roles are bounded. In this paper, we propose a symbolic framework to overcome this difficulty. We design an automated security analysis technique, parametric in the number of users and roles, by adapting recent methods for model checking infinite state systems that use first-order logic and state-of-the-art theorem proving techniques. Preliminary experiments with a prototype implementations seem to confirm the scalability of our technique.

  title: Efficient symbolic automated analysis of administrative attribute-based RBAC-policies
  authors: Francesco Alberti, Alessandro Armando, Silvio Ranise
  abstract: >
    Automated techniques for the security analysis of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) access control policies are crucial for their design and maintenance. The definition of administrative domains by means of attributes attached to users makes the RBAC model easier to use in real scenarios but complicates the development of security analysis techniques, that should be able to modularly reason about a wide range of attribute domains. In this paper, we describe an automated symbolic security analysis technique for administrative attribute-based RBAC policies. A class of formulae of first-order logic is used as an adequate symbolic representation for the policies and their administrative actions. State-of-the-art automated theorem proving techniques are used (off-the-shelf) to mechanize the security analysis procedure. Besides discussing the assumptions for the effectiveness and termination of the procedure, we demonstrate its efficiency through an extensive empirical evaluation.

  title: "ASASP: Automated Symbolic Analysis of Security Policies"
  authors: Francesco Alberti, Alessandro Armando, Silvio Ranise
  abstract: >
    We describe asasp, a symbolic reachability procedure for the analysis of administrative access control policies. The tool represents access policies and their administrative actions as formulae of the Bernays-Shönfinkel-Ramsey class and then uses a symbolic reachability procedure to solve security analysis problems. Checks for fix-point—reduced to satisfiability problems—are mechanized by Satisfiability Modulo Theories solving and Automated Theorem Proving. asasp has been successfully applied to the analysis of benchmark problems arising in (extensions of) the Role-Based Access Control model. Our tool shows better scalability than a state-of-the-art tool on a significant set of instances of these problems.

  title: Boosting Model Checking to Analyse Large ARBAC Policies
  authors: Silvio Ranise, Anh Truong, Alessandro Armando
  abstract: >
    The administration of access control policies is a task of paramount importance for distributed systems. A crucial analysis problem is to foresee if a set of administrators can give a user an access permission. We consider this analysis problem in the context of the Administrative Role-Based Access Control (ARBAC), one of the most widespread administrative models. Given the difficulty of taking into account the effect of all possible administrative actions, automated analysis techniques are needed. In this paper, we describe how a model checker can scale up to handle very large ARBAC policies while ensuring completeness. An extensive experimentation shows that an implementation of our techniques performs significantly better than Mohawk, a recently proposed tool that has become the reference for finding errors in ARBAC policies.

  title: Verification of Composed Array-based Systems with Applications to Security-Aware Workflows
  authors: Clara Bertolissi and Silvio Ranise
  abstract: >
    We introduce a class of symbolic transition systems capable of representing collections of security-aware workflows and we study the verification of reachability properties of such systems. More precisely, we define composed array-based systems as an extension of array-based systems in which array variables are indexed over more than one type. For an application relevant sub-class of these systems we show how to mechanize a symbolic backward reachability procedure by modularly re-using the techniques developed for array-based systems. Finally, and most importantly, we find sufficient conditions for the termination of the procedure and we apply this result to derive the decidability of the reachability problems of two important classes of security-aware workflow systems.

  authors: Alessandro Armando, Sander Oudkerk, Silvio Ranise and Konrad Wrona
  abstract: >
    The successful operation of NATO missions requires effective and secure sharing of information among coalition partners and external organizations, while avoiding the disclosure of sensitive information to untrusted users. To resolve the conflict between confidentiality and availability, NATO is developing a new information sharing infrastructure, called Content-based Protection and Release. We describe the architecture of access control in NATO operations, which is designed to be easily built on top of available (service-oriented) infrastructures for identity and access control management. We then present a use case scenario drawn from the NATO Passive Missile Defence system for simulating the consequences of intercepting missile attacks. In the system demonstration, we show how maps annotated with the findings of the system are filtered by the access control module to produce appropriate views for users with different clearances and terminals under given release and protection policies.

  title: "Incremental Analysis of Evolving Administrative Role Based Access Control Policies"
  authors: "Silvio Ranise, Anh Truong"
  abstract: >
    We consider the safety problem for Administrative Role-Based Access Control (ARBAC) policies, i.e. detecting whether sequences of administrative actions can result in policies by which a user can acquire permissions that may compromise some security goals. In particular, we are interested in sequences of safety problems generated by modifications (namely, adding/deleting an element to/from the set of possible actions) to an ARBAC policy accommodating the evolving needs of an organization. or resulting from fixing some safety issues. Since problems in such sequences share almost all administrative actions, we propose an incremental technique that avoids the re-computation of the solution to the current problem by re-using much of the work done on the previous problem in a sequence. An experimental evaluation shows the better performances of an implementation of our technique with respect to the only available approach to solve safety problems for evolving ARBAC policies proposed by Gofman, Luo, and Yang.

  title: "A delegated authorization solution for smart-city mobile applications"
  authors: Giada Sciarretta, Roberto Carbone, and Silvio Ranise
  abstract: >
    An increasingly popular scenario for Smart Cities is the one in which mobile apps attempt to access resources (e.g., open data about public transportation or e-government services) made available by city authorities through the use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). There is a growing awareness of the benefits of using APIs to foster civic engagement through a more efficient and personalized delivery of government services, and as an enabler of a new wave of innovation contributing to a more automated and sustainable city functioning. Despite these advantages, there are several factors hindering the exploitation of APIs. One of the most important technical barriers to the creation of mobile apps following the recurrent pattern of consuming data (e.g., selected parts of open data or user profiles) stored by other applications or services is the lack of a secure delegation mechanism. In this paper, we discuss the main security issues underlying the design of such a delegation mechanism for Smart City mobile apps and present a solution-based on OAuth 2.0-overcoming the security problems. An implementation of the solution has been integrated in the Smart Community Platform for developing open services in the Trentino region and is being used daily by up to 13,000 users. To date, no security issue has been reported.

  abstract: >
    While there exist many secure authentication and authorization solutions for web applications, their adaptation in the mobile context is a new and open challenge. In this paper, we argue that the lack of a proper reference model for Single Sign-On (SSO) for mobile native applications drives many social network vendors (acting as Identity Providers) to develop their own mobile solution. However, as the implementation details are not well documented, it is difficult to establish the proper security level of these solutions. We thus provide a rational reconstruction of the Facebook SSO flow, including a comparison with the OAuth 2.0 standard and a security analysis obtained testing the Facebook SSO reconstruction against a set of identified SSO attacks. Based on this analysis, we have modified and generalized the Facebook solution proposing a native SSO solution capable of solving the identified vulnerabilities and accommodating any Identity Provider.

We focus on access control for cloud-edge based IoT solutions for which—in previous work—we have proposed a lazy approach to Access Control as a Service for the specification, administration, and enforcement of policies. The validity of the approach was evaluated in a realistic smart-lock scenario. In this paper, we argue that the approach is adaptable to a wide range of IoT use case scenarios by validating the requirements elicited when analyzing the smart lock scenario.

  authors: Roberto Carbone, Silvio Ranise and Giada Sciarretta
  abstract: >
    The widespread use of digital identities in our everyday life, along with the release of our sensitive data on many online transactions, calls for Identity Management (IdM) solutions that are secure, usable, privacy-aware, and compatible with new technologies, such as mobile and cloud. While there exist many secure IdM solutions for web applications, their adaptation in the mobile context is a new and open challenge. Due to the lack of specifications and security guidelines, designing a mobile IdM solution that covers different authentication aspects from scratch is not a simple task; and as its security depends on several trust and communication assumptions, in most cases, could result in a solution with hidden vulnerabilities. To overcome this difficulty, we provide a reference model and a design methodology which can be used by different organizations to implement mobile Single Sign-On and multi-factor authentication. Main objectives of the workshop are to create awareness of privacy and security issues together with legal provisions related to authentication in mobile computing and perform an experimental evaluation of security vs usability of widespread second-factor authentication solutions for mobile applications.

  abstract: >
    Over the last few years, there has been an almost exponential increase of the number of mobile applications that deal with sensitive data, such as applications for e-commerce or health. When dealing with sensitive data, classical authentication solutions based on username-password pairs are not enough, and multi-factor authentication solutions that combine two or more authentication elements of different categories are required. Many different such solutions are available, but they usually cover the scenario of a user accessing web applications on their laptops, whereas in this paper we focus on native mobile applications. This changes the exploitable attack surface and thus requires a specific analysis. In this paper, we present the design, the formal specification and the security analysis of a solution that allows users to access different mobile applications through a multi-factor authentication solution providing a Single Sign-On experience. The formal and automated analysis that we performed validates the security goals of the solution we propose.

  authors: Salvatore Manfredi, Silvio Ranise and Giada Sciarretta
  abstract: >
    Over the last few years, there has been an almost exponential growth of TLS popularity and usage, especially among applications that deal with sensitive data. However, even with this widespread use, TLS remains for many system administrators a complex subject. The main reason is that they do not have the time to understand all the cryptographic algorithms and features used in a TLS suite and their relative weaknesses. For these reasons, many different tools have been developed to verify TLS implementations. However, they usually analyze the TLS configuration and provide a list of possible attacks, without specifying their mitigations. In this paper, we present TLSAssistant, a fully-featured tool that combines state-of-the-art TLS analyzers with a report system that suggests appropriate mitigations and shows the full set of viable attacks.

  abstract: >
    In recent years, the usage of online services (e.g., banking) has considerably increased. To protect the sensitive resources managed by these services against attackers, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) has been widely adopted. To date, a variety of MFA protocols have been implemented, leveraging different designs and features and providing a non-homogeneous level of security and user experience. Public and private authorities have defined laws and guidelines to guide the design of more secure and usable MFA protocols, but their influence on existing MFA implementations remains unclear.
    We present MuFASA, a tool for high-level specification and analysis of MFA protocols, which aims at supporting normal users and security experts (in the design phase of an MFA protocol), providing a high level report regarding possible risks associated to the specified MFA protocol, its resistance to a set of attacker models (defined by NIST), its ease-of-use and its compliance with a set of security requirements derived from European laws.

  title: A Wizard-Based Approach for Secure Code Generation of Single Sign-On and Access Delegation Solutions for Mobile Native Apps
  authors: Amir Sharif, Roberto Carbone, Silvio Ranise and Giada Sciarretta
  abstract: >
    Many available mobile applications (apps) have poorly implemented Single Sign-On and Access Delegation solutions leading to serious security issues. This could be caused by inexperienced developers who prioritize the implementation of core functionalities and/or misunderstand security critical parts. The situation is even worse in complex API scenarios where the app interacts with several providers. To address these problems, we propose a novel wizard-based approach that guides developers to integrate multiple third-party Identity Management (IdM) providers in their apps, by (i) “enforcing” the usage of best practices for native apps, (ii) avoiding the need to download several SDKs and understanding their online documentations (a list of known IdM providers with their configuration information is embedded within our approach), and (iii) automatically generating the code to enable the communication with the different IdM providers. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been assessed by implementing an Android Studio plugin and using it to integrate several IdM providers, such as OKTA, Auth0, Microsoft, and Google.

  title: "Security Considerations on 5G-Enabled Back-Situation Awareness for CCAM"
  authors: Marco Centenaro, Stefano Berlato, Roberto Carbone, Gianfranco Burzio, Giuseppe Faranda Cordella, Silvio Ranise and Roberto Riggio
  abstract: >
    The increasing demand for cooperative, connected, and automated mobility (CCAM) services should proceed at the same pace with the enforcement of security mechanisms that would make CCAM services secure. The first contribution of this paper resides in a review of the ongoing regulatory and standardization activities related to cybersecurity of autonomous vehicles. Then, referring to the ongoing piloting activities funded by the European Union, we focus on the security threats for back-situation awareness (BSA), i.e., a safety-related CCAM service dealing with emergency scenarios. We propose a practical strong authentication method for BSA, and extensively discuss how existing standards can mitigate the security threats of this prominent CCAM service.

  title: "Exploring Architectures for Cryptographic Access Control Enforcement in the Cloud for Fun and Optimization"
  authors: Stefano Berlato, Roberto Carbone, Adam J. Lee and Silvio Ranise
  abstract: >
    To facilitate the adoption of cloud by organizations, Cryptographic Access Control (CAC) is the obvious solution to control data sharing among users while preventing partially trusted Cloud Service Providers (CSP) to access sensitive data. Indeed, several CAC schemes have been proposed in the literature. Despite their differences, available solutions are based on a common set of entities—e.g., a data storage service or a proxy mediating the access of users to encrypted data—that operate in different (security) domains—e.g., on-premise or the CSP. However, the majority of the CAC schemes assumes a fixed assignment of entities to domains; this has security and usability implications that are not made explicit and can make inappropriate the use of a CAC scheme in certain scenarios with specific requirements. For instance, assuming that the proxy runs at the premises of the organization avoids the vendor lock-in effect but may substantially mine scalability. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work considers how to select the best possible architecture (i.e., the assignment of entities to domains) to deploy a CAC scheme for the requirements of a given scenario. In this paper, we propose a methodology to assist administrators to explore different architectures of CAC schemes for a given scenario. We do this by identifying the possible architectures underlying the CAC schemes available in the literature and formalize them in simple set theory. This allows us to reduce the problem of selecting the most suitable architecture satisfying a heterogeneous set of requirements arising from the considered scenario to a Multi-Objective Optimization Problem (MOOP) for which state-of-the-art solvers can be invoked. Finally, we show how the capability of solving the MOOP can be used to build a prototype tool assisting administrators to preliminary perform a ``What-if'' analysis to explore the trade-offs among the various architectures and then use available standards and tools (such as TOSCA and Cloudify) for automated deployment in multiple CSPs.

  title: "The Good, the Bad and the (Not So) Ugly of Out-Of-Band Authentication with eID Cards and Push Notifications: Design, Formal and Risk Analysis"
  authors: Marco Pernpruner, Roberto Carbone, Silvio Ranise, Giada Sciarretta
  abstract: >
    Everyday life is permeated by new technologies allowing people to perform almost any kind of operation from their smart devices. Although this is amazing from a convenience perspective, it may result in several security issues concerning the need for authenticating users in a proper and secure way. Electronic identity cards (also called eID cards) play a very important role in this regard, due to the high level of assurance they provide in identification and authentication processes. However, authentication solutions relying on them are still uncommon and suffer from many usability limitations. In this paper, we thus present the design and implementation of a novel passwordless, multi-factor authentication protocol based on eID cards. To reduce known usability issues while keeping a high level of security, our protocol leverages push notifications and mobile devices equipped with NFC, which can be used to interact with eID cards. In addition, we evaluate the security of the protocol through a formal security analysis and a risk analysis, whose results emphasize the acceptable level of security.

  title: "A Survey on Multi-Factor Authentication for Online Banking in the Wild"
  authors: Federico Sinigaglia, Roberto Carbone, Gabriele Costa, Nicola Zannone
  abstract: >
    In recent years, the usage of online banking services has considerably increased. To protect the sensitive resources managed by these services against attackers, banks have started adopting Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). To date, a variety of MFA solutions have been implemented by banks, leveraging different designs and features and providing a non-homogeneous level of security and user experience. Public and private authorities have defined laws and guidelines to guide the design of more secure and usable MFA solutions, but their influence on existing MFA implementations remains unclear. In this work, we present a latitudinal study on the adoption of MFA and the design choices made by banks operating in different countries. In particular, we evaluate the MFA solutions currently adopted in the banking sector in terms of (i) compliance with laws and best practices, (ii) robustness against attacks and (iii) complexity. We also investigate possible correlations between these criteria. Based on this study, we identify a number of lessons learned and open challenges.

  title: "Micro-Id-Gym: a Flexible Tool for Pentesting Identity Management Protocols in the Wild and in the Laboratory"
  authors: Andrea Bisegna, Roberto Carbone, Giulio Pellizzari and Silvio Ranise
  abstract: >
    Identity Management (IdM) solutions are increasingly important for digital infrastructures of both enterprises and public administrations. Their security is a mandatory pre-requisite for building trust in current and future digital ecosystems. Unfortunately, not only their secure deployment but even their usage are non-trivial activities that require a good level of security awareness. In order to test whether known exploits can be reproduced in different environments, better understand their effects and facilitate the discovery of new vulnerabilities, we need to have a reliable testbed. For this, we present Micro-Id-Gym which abstractly supports two main activities: the creation of sandboxes with an IdM protocol deployment and the pentesting of IdM protocol deployments in the wild or in the laboratory (on the created sandboxes).

  title: Automated and Secure Integration of the OpenID Connect iGov Profile in Mobile Native Applications
  authors: Amir Sharif, Roberto Carbone, Giada Sciarretta, Silvio Ranise
  abstract: >
    Electronic identification schemes have been built to simplify citizens access to online public administration services and reduce password fatigue via a single sign-on experience. To provide a precise specification for government and public service domains on how to protect the user’s identity information and activity from unintentional exposure, the OAuth working group together with the OpenID Connect foundation have published the International Government Assurance Profile (iGov) document. As the specification contains high-level concepts and brings together a lot of insights from already published documents to increase the baseline security and structure deployments, it may be unclear or misleading for mobile application developers. This is mainly due to the fact that firstly, they are not usually security experts and secondly, the aforementioned documents are not mostly designed for the native applications that can affect the implementation security based on the differences between the native and web environment. The aforementioned source of uncertainty for inexperienced developers can lead to various threats that can expose user’s resources. To avoid these problems, we demystify the iGov profile for non-security experts by extracting the wealth information from the iGov specifications, and we apply the best current practices for native applications within the iGov profile to conceptualize the flow for native applications. Furthermore, we provide a wizard-based approach to automatically integrate the secure code for the iGov profile in Android native applications.

  title: A Large-Scale Study on the Adoption of Anti-Debugging and Anti-Tampering Protections in Android Apps
  authors: Stefano Berlato, Mariano Ceccato
  abstract: >
    Android apps are subject to malicious reverse engineering and code tampering for many reasons, like premium features unlocking and malware piggybacking. Scientific literature and practitioners proposed several Anti-Debugging and Anti-Tampering protections, readily implementable by app developers, to empower Android apps to react against malicious reverse engineering actively. However, the extent to which Android app developers deploy these protections is not known. In this paper, we describe a large-scale study on Android apps to quantify the practical adoption of Anti-Debugging and Anti-Tampering protections. We analyzed 14,173 apps from 2015 and 23,610 apps from 2019 from the Google Play Store. Our analysis shows that 59% of these apps implement neither Anti-Debugging nor Anti-Tampering protections. Moreover, half of the remaining apps deploy only one protection, not exploiting the variety of available protections. We also observe that app developers prefer Java to Native protections by a ratio of 99 to 1. Finally, we note that apps in 2019 employ more protections against reverse engineering than apps in 2015.

  title: "Deploying Access Control Enforcement for IoT in the Cloud-Edge Continuum with the help of the CAP Theorem"
  authors: Tahir Ahmad, Umberto Morelli and Silvio Ranise
  abstract: >
    The CAP Theorem is used by distributed system practitioners to investigate the necessary trade-offs in the design and development of distributed systems, mainly databases and web applications. In this paper, we use it to reason about access control systems designed for the Internet of Things (IoT). 
    We validate our approach by experimentally investigating alternative architectural designs to enforce access control in a smart lock system using the cloud-edge IoT platform offered by Amazon. 
    We discuss the trade-off between security and performance that may help IoT designers choose the most suitable architecture supporting their requirements.

  title: "Multi-Stakeholder Cybersecurity Risk Assessment for Data Protection"
  authors: Majid Mollaeefar, Alberto Siena, Silvio Ranise
  abstract: >
    To ensure the effectiveness of the adopted security measures and minimize the impact of security issues on the rights and freedom of individuals, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires to carry out a Data Processing Impact Assessment (DPIA). Such an assessment differs from traditional risk analyses in which the actor carrying out the evaluation is also the one interested in reducing its risk. Conflicts may thus arise between the need of protecting data subjects rights and organizations that shall provide adequate security measures while struggling with various types of constraints (e.g., budget). To alleviate this problem, we introduce the Multi-Stakeholder Risk Trade-off Analysis Problem, (MSRToAP) and propose an automated technique to solve their instances. We then show how this can help data controllers make more informed decisions about which security mechanisms allow for a better trade-off between their requirements and those of the data subjects. For concreteness, we illustrate the proposed on a simple yet realistic use case scenario.

  title: Formal Analysis of Mobile Multi-Factor Authentication with Single Sign-On Login
  authors: Roberto Carbone, Silvio Ranise, Giada Sciarretta and Luca Viganò
  abstract: >
    Over the last few years, there has been an almost exponential increase in the number of mobile applications that deal with sensitive data, such as applications for e-commerce or health. When dealing with sensitive data, classical authentication solutions based on username-password pairs are not enough, and multi-factor authentication solutions that combine two or more authentication factors of different categories are required instead. Even if several solutions are currently used, their security analyses have been performed informally or semi-formally at best, and without a reference model and a precise definition of the multi-factor authentication property. This makes a comparison among the different solutions both complex and potentially misleading. In this paper, we first present the design of two reference models for native applications based on the requirements of two real-world use-case scenarios. Common features between them are the use of one-time password approaches and the support of a single sign-on experience. Then, we provide a formal specification of our threat model and the security goals, and discuss the automated security analysis that we performed. Our formal analysis validates the security goals of the two reference models we propose and provides an important building block for the formal analysis of different multi-factor authentication solutions.

  title: "Secure Pull Printing with QR Codes and National eID Cards: A Software-oriented Design and an Open-source Implementation"
  authors: Matteo Leonelli, Umberto Morelli, Silvio Ranise, Giada Sciarretta
  abstract: >
    With more systems becoming digitized, enterprises are adopting cloud technologies and outsourcing non-critical services to reduce the pressure on IT departments. In this process, it is crucial to achieving the right balance between costs, usability and security; prioritizing security over the rest when handling sensitive data. Considering the print management, often off-premise, many enterprises report at least one print-related security incident that led to data loss in the past year. This problem can damage the enterprise business, in particular considering the fines prescribed by current regulations or its reputation. Focusing on securing enterprise printing, pull printing is the set of technologies and processes that allow the release of print jobs according to specific conditions; typically user authentication and proximity to a printer. We design a software-oriented pull printing infrastructure that supports a print release mechanism using QR codes and electronic IDentity cards as a second-factor authenticator. Our solution addresses the costs, as any medium-size organization can adopt our open-source solution without additional devices or access badges; and the user experience, as we offer a driverless print environment and a user-friendly mobile application.

  title: "A Framework for Security and Risk Analysis of Enrollment Procedures: Application to Fully-Remote Solutions Based on eDocuments"
  authors: Marco Pernpruner, Giada Sciarretta, and Silvio Ranise
  abstract: >
    More and more online services are characterised by the need for strongly verifying the real-world identity of end users, especially when sensitive operations have to be carried out: just imagine a fully-remote signature of a contract, and what could happen whether someone managed to perform it by using another person's name. For this reason, the identity management lifecycle contains specific procedures – called enrollment or onboarding – providing a certain level of assurance on digital users' real identities. These procedures must be as secure as possible to prevent frauds and identity thefts. In this paper, we present a framework composed of a specification language, a security analysis methodology and a risk analysis methodology for enrollment solutions. For concreteness, we apply our framework to a real use case (i.e., fully-remote solutions relying on electronic documents as identity evidence) in the context of a collaboration with an Italian FinTech startup. Beyond validating the framework, we analyse and highlight the essential role of mitigations on the overall security of enrollment procedures.
